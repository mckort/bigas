```bash
curl -X POST https://your-deployment-url.com/mcp/tools/ask_analytics_question \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Which country had the most active users last week?"}'
```

This endpoint uses AI to interpret your question and return relevant analytics data in a natural, conversational format.

### Weekly Analytics Reports

Generate comprehensive weekly reports and post them to Discord:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-deployment-url.com/mcp/tools/weekly_analytics_report \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

This endpoint automatically:
- Fetches the last 7 days of analytics data
- Generates a comprehensive report with key metrics
- Posts the report to your configured Discord channel
- Creates an AI-powered Q&A summary of the report

### Custom Analytics Reports

Create tailored reports with specific dimensions and metrics:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-deployment-url.com/mcp/tools/fetch_custom_report \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "dimensions": ["country", "device_category"],
    "metrics": ["active_users", "sessions"],
    "date_ranges": [{"start_date": "2024-01-01", "end_date": "2024-01-31"}]
  }'
```

### Standard Analytics Reports

Get predefined analytics reports:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-deployment-url.com/mcp/tools/fetch_analytics_report \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"date_range": "last_7_days"}'
```

### Trend Analysis

Analyze data trends over time:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-deployment-url.com/mcp/tools/analyze_trends \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"metric": "active_users", "date_range": "last_30_days"}'
```

## üß™ Testing Weekly Analytics Reports

The weekly analytics report endpoint generates comprehensive reports and posts them to your configured Discord channel. Here's how to test it:

### Testing the Endpoint

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-deployment-url.app/mcp/tools/weekly_analytics_report \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### What Gets Posted to Discord

When you run this endpoint, it automatically:
1. Fetches the last 7 days of Google Analytics data
2. Generates a comprehensive report with key metrics
3. Posts the report to your Discord channel
4. Creates an AI-powered Q&A summary

### Example Discord Output

Here's what you'll see posted to your Discord channel:

```
Weekly Analytics report on its way...

Q: What are the primary traffic sources contributing to total sessions?
A: Here's how your 43 total sessions broke down by channel:
‚Ä¢ Organic Search: 19 sessions (44%)
‚Ä¢ Direct: 18 sessions (42%)
‚Ä¢ Organic Social: 6 sessions (14%)

Key takeaways:
‚Ä¢ Organic Search is your top source, closely followed by Direct visits
‚Ä¢ Social is a smaller driver of traffic right now
‚Ä¢ Referral, paid search and email all registered zero sessions‚Äîthese could be untapped opportunities

Q: What is the average session duration and pages per session?
A: Across all users, you had 43 sessions, with a total engagement time of 764 seconds and 95 page views:
‚Ä¢ Average session duration ‚âà 17.8 seconds
‚Ä¢ Pages per session ‚âà 2.2

Key takeaways:
‚Ä¢ An average visit of under 20 seconds is quite short
‚Ä¢ Viewing just over two pages per visit suggests modest exploration

Q: Which pages are the most visited?
A: Top pages by sessions:
‚Ä¢ Homepage "/" ‚Äì 38 sessions
‚Ä¢ Get-in-touch "/get-in-touch-with-us" ‚Äì 13 sessions
‚Ä¢ About us "/about-us" ‚Äì 9 sessions

Summary Recommendations:
‚Ä¢ Set up and verify conversion tracking
‚Ä¢ Boost homepage engagement & conversions
‚Ä¢ Optimize high-traffic Contact & About Us pages
‚Ä¢ Deepen session duration & page depth
‚Ä¢ Diversify traffic sources
```

### Prerequisites

Before testing, ensure you have:
- ‚úÖ `GA4_PROPERTY_ID` configured
- ‚úÖ `OPENAI_API_KEY` configured  
- ‚úÖ `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` configured
- ‚úÖ Valid Google Analytics data for the last 7 days

### Testing Tips

- **First Time**: Run once to verify Discord integration works
- **Data Check**: Ensure your GA4 property has recent data
- **Webhook Test**: Verify your Discord webhook URL is correct
- **Rate Limits**: The report generation can take 30-60 seconds

### Scheduling Weekly Reports

For automated weekly reports, you can use **Google Cloud Scheduler** to call the endpoint automatically. This allows you to:

- **Schedule regular reports**: Set up weekly, daily, or custom intervals
- **Automate workflows**: No manual intervention required
- **Flexible timing**: Choose the best time for your team to receive reports
- **Easy management**: Pause, resume, or update schedules as needed

Simply configure a Cloud Scheduler job to make a POST request to your weekly analytics report endpoint at your preferred schedule.
