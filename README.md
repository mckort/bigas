# Bigas - AI Team for Solo Founders, Built for Vibe Coding

Welcome to Bigas, an open-source project hosted on GitHub, designed to empower solo entrepreneurs by providing a virtual team of AI-powered resources. The name Bigas is derived from Latin, meaning "team," and reflects our mission to create a collaborative ecosystem of AI tools to support entrepreneurs in building and scaling their ventures. Our vision is to make advanced AI capabilities accessible to individuals who are navigating the entrepreneurial journey solo, enabling them to achieve more with less.

## Project Overview

Bigas (meaning "my team") is a modular, open-source platform that leverages cutting-edge AI tools to simulate the expertise of a dedicated team. By integrating with coding tools like Cursor, Bigas enables solo entrepreneurs to streamline workflows, automate tasks, and gain actionable insights without the need for extensive technical expertise or a large team.

The initial focus of Bigas is a **Marketing Analytics Resource**, a powerful AI-driven tool that connects to Google Analytics to extract, analyze, and interpret data. This resource provides detailed observations and actionable recommendations to optimize marketing strategies, improve user engagement, and drive business growth. Whether you're looking to enhance your website's performance, refine your campaigns, or better understand your audience, Bigas equips you with the insights needed to make data-driven decisions.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The Bigas platform is designed as a **Modular Monolith**. This architecture provides the scalability benefits of microservices (like separation of concerns) without the initial operational complexity. A central API gateway routes requests to independent "AI Resources" that are managed within the same application.

Here is a high-level overview of the current structure:

```text
+--------------------------+
|         Clients          |
|  - Manual User (curl)    |
|  - Google Cloud Scheduler|
+--------------------------+
             |
             v
+--------------------------+
|   Google Cloud Run       |
|  (Hosting Environment)   |
+--------------------------+
             |
             v
+-------------------------------------------------+
|  Bigas Platform (app.py - Flask App)            |
|                                                 |

|   | (/marketing/*)       | (/product/*)         |
|   v                      v                      |
| +----------------------+ +--------------------+ |
| | Marketing Resource   | | Product Resource   | |
| | (Connects to GA,     | | (Placeholder for   | |
| |  OpenAI, Discord)    | |  Jira, Figma, etc) | |
| +----------------------+ +--------------------+ |
|                                                 |
+-------------------------------------------------+
```

### Data Flow Explained:

1.  **Clients**: A user or automated service sends an HTTP request to an endpoint.
2.  **Google Cloud Run**: The request is received by the hosting environment.
3.  **Bigas Platform (`app.py`)**: The main Flask application receives the request.
4.  **API Router**: The app's internal router inspects the URL and forwards the request to the appropriate resource module.
    *   Requests to `/mcp/tools/ask_analytics_question` are routed to the **Marketing Resource**.
    *   A future request to `/mcp/tools/get_sprint_summary` would be routed to the **Product Resource**.
5.  **AI Resource**: The specific resource (e.g., Marketing) contains all the business logic to connect to external APIs (Google Analytics, OpenAI, etc.) and fulfill the request.
6.  **Response**: The resource returns a response, which is sent back to the client.

This structure allows you to easily add new resources (Sales, Support, etc.) by simply creating a new module in the `bigas/resources` directory, with minimal changes to the core application.
