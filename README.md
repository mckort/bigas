## 🚀 Quick Start & Deployment

### Environment Configuration

Bigas-core runs in standalone mode with direct Google Analytics 4 integration:
#### **Standalone Deployment**
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env and configure your actual API keys and values
nano .env

# Deploy with your configured credentials
./deploy.sh
```
- ✅ **Simple configuration** - just add your API keys
- ✅ **No external dependencies** - fully self-contained
- 🔧 **Full control** over all settings

#### **Standalone Mode (`DEPLOYMENT_MODE=standalone`)**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites Setup

#### Google Cloud Setup
Before deploying, you need to set up Google Cloud:

- Install and authenticate with Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud`)
- Create a Google Cloud project
- Enable Cloud Run and Analytics APIs
- Create a service account for Google Analytics 4 access

See the [Google Cloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs) for detailed setup instructions.

#### Google Analytics Authentication
You need to authenticate with Google Analytics 4:

- Create a service account in your Google Cloud project
- Grant the service account "Viewer" permissions to your GA4 property
- Download the service account key file

### 1. Set Up Google Cloud Project

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project** (if you don't have one)
2. **Enable required APIs**:
   - Google Analytics Data API
   - Google Cloud Storage API
3. **Create a service account** with the following roles:
   - `roles/analyticsdata.reader` - Read GA4 data
   - `roles/storage.objectAdmin` - Manage storage objects
4. **Download the service account key file**

### 2. Set Up Google Analytics 4 Property Access

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: You must grant your service account access to your GA4 property for bigas to fetch data.

#### **Step 1: Get Your GA4 Property ID**
1. Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
2. Select your GA4 property
3. Go to **Admin** → **Property details**
4. Copy the **Property ID** (format: `123456789`)

#### **Step 2: Grant Service Account Access**
1. In Google Analytics, go to **Admin** → **Property Access Management**
2. Click **+** to add a new user
3. **Email**: Enter your service account email (if using Google Cloud)
4. **Role**: Select **"Marketer"** (minimum required role for full data access)
5. Click **Add**

**Troubleshooting**: If you get a 403 error, wait longer for permissions to propagate or verify the service account email is correct.

### 3. Set Up Google Cloud Storage

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Google Cloud Storage must be activated and a bucket must be created for report storage.

1. **Activate Google Cloud Storage API** (if not already done in step 1)
2. **Create a storage bucket**:
   ```bash
   # Create a bucket (replace with your preferred name)
   gsutil mb gs://your-bucket-name
   
   # Or use the default name that will be created automatically
   gsutil mb gs://bigas-analytics-reports
   ```
3. **Note the bucket name** - you'll need it for the `STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME` environment variable

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and configure your variables:

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp env.example .env

# Edit the file with your actual values
nano .env
```

**Required environment variables** (see `env.example` for details):
- `GA4_PROPERTY_ID` - Your Google Analytics 4 property ID (found in GA4 Admin → Property Settings)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key
- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` - Your Discord webhook URL
- `STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME` - Your Google Cloud Storage bucket (optional, defaults to 'bigas-analytics-reports')
- `TARGET_KEYWORDS` - Colon-separated list of target keywords for SEO analysis (optional, e.g., "sustainable_swag:eco_friendly_clothing:green_promos")

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: You must add your actual API keys and values to the `.env` file. The `env.example` file only contains placeholder values.

### 8. Automate Weekly Reports (Recommended)

For automated weekly reports, set up Google Cloud Scheduler:

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**
   - Navigate to [Cloud Scheduler](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudscheduler)
   - Select your project

2. **Create a new job**
   - Click "Create Job"
   - **Name**: `weekly-analytics-report`
   - **Region**: Choose your preferred region
   - **Description**: `Automated weekly analytics reports for Bigas`

3. **Configure the schedule**
   - **Frequency**: `0 9 * * 1` (Every Monday at 9 AM)
   - **Timezone**: Choose your timezone (e.g., America/New_York)

4. **Configure the target**
   - **Target type**: HTTP
   - **URL**: `https://your-deployment-url.com/mcp/tools/weekly_analytics_report`
   - **HTTP method**: POST

5. **Save the job**

This will automatically post weekly analytics reports to your Discord channel every Monday at 9 AM.

**Schedule Examples:**
- `0 9 * * 1` - Every Monday at 9 AM
- `0 9 * * 1,4` - Every Monday and Thursday at 9 AM  
- `0 9 1 * *` - First day of every month at 9 AM
- `0 */6 * * *` - Every 6 hours

### 9. Structured Recommendations Format

The AI generates exactly 8 structured recommendations with this format:

```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "fact": "The data shows a 27.1% decrease in active users from 48 to 35 over the last 30 days",
      "recommendation": "Investigate marketing strategy changes and evaluate recent campaign performance",
      "category": "analytics",
      "priority": "high",
      "impact_score": 8
    }
  ]
}
```

**Fact Requirements:**
- ✅ **GOOD**: "Direct traffic accounts for 55.7% of sessions, Organic Social 31.1%, Organic Search only 8.2%"
- ✅ **GOOD**: "The homepage has 36 sessions with 154 total events (4.3 events per session) showing good engagement"
- ❌ **BAD**: "Traffic has been declining" (no specific numbers)
- ❌ **BAD**: "Most traffic comes from social media" (no percentages)

**Event-Aware Analysis:**
- Events (page_view, scroll, user_engagement, click) are considered **positive engagement signals**
- A page with "zero conversions" but high events may actually have good engagement
- The AI highlights event numbers to show the complete engagement picture

### 10. Analyze Underperforming Pages (New!)

The weekly reports are now automatically stored in Google Cloud Storage, enabling you to analyze underperforming pages and get AI-powered improvement suggestions:

#### Set up a second Cloud Scheduler job for page analysis:

1. **Create another Cloud Scheduler job**
   - **Name**: `analyze-underperforming-pages`
   - **Frequency**: `0 10 * * 2` (Every Tuesday at 10 AM, after the weekly report)
   - **URL**: `https://your-deployment-url.com/mcp/tools/analyze_underperforming_pages`
   - **HTTP method**: POST

This will automatically analyze the latest weekly report, identify underperforming pages, and generate specific improvement suggestions.

#### Manual analysis:

```bash
# Get a list of all stored reports
curl -X GET https://your-deployment-url.com/mcp/tools/get_stored_reports

# Get the latest report with summary
curl -X GET https://your-deployment-url.com/mcp/tools/get_latest_report

# Analyze underperforming pages from the latest report
curl -X POST https://your-deployment-url.com/mcp/tools/analyze_underperforming_pages

# Analyze underperforming pages from a specific date
curl -X POST https://your-deployment-url.com/mcp/tools/analyze_underperforming_pages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"report_date": "2024-01-15"}'

# Clean up old reports (keep last 30 days)
curl -X POST https://your-deployment-url.com/mcp/tools/cleanup_old_reports \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"keep_days": 30}'
```

The analysis will provide:
- **Priority-ranked improvements** (High/Medium/Low)
- **Effort estimates** (Quick/Easy/Complex)
- **Expected impact** for each suggestion
- **Specific action items** you can implement immediately
- **Actual page URLs** for direct access to underperforming pages

## 🔗 URL Extraction & Domain Detection

### Overview

The enhanced storage system automatically extracts actual page URLs from Google Analytics data, making underperforming pages analysis much more actionable.

### How It Works

#### 1. Weekly Report Generation
When the weekly report runs, it now stores:
- **AI-generated answers** (human-readable insights)
- **Raw GA4 data** (structured data with URLs)

#### 2. URL Extraction Process
The system automatically:
1. **Identifies** the underperforming pages question
2. **Extracts** page paths from the raw GA4 data
3. **Converts** paths to full URLs using actual domain from GA4
4. **Calculates** conversion rates and metrics
5. **Flags** underperforming pages

#### 3. Analysis Enhancement
The analysis endpoint now receives:
- **Specific page URLs** instead of just page names
- **Detailed metrics** for each page
- **Conversion rates** for context

### Example Output

#### Before (Page Names Only)
```
"Are there underperforming pages with high traffic but low conversions?"
Answer: "Yes, the Home page and About Us page have high traffic but no conversions."
```

#### After (With URLs and Metrics)
```json
{
  "underperforming_pages": [
    {
      "question": "Are there underperforming pages with high traffic but low conversions?",
      "answer": "Yes, the Home page and About Us page have high traffic but no conversions."
    }
  ],
  "page_urls": [
    {
      "page_path": "/",
      "hostname": "bigas.com",
      "page_url": "https://bigas.com/",
      "sessions": 39,
      "conversions": 0,
      "conversion_rate": 0.0,
      "is_underperforming": true
    },
    {
      "page_path": "/about-us",
      "hostname": "bigas.com",
      "page_url": "https://bigas.com/about-us",
      "sessions": 10,
      "conversions": 0,
      "conversion_rate": 0.0,
      "is_underperforming": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Enhanced Report Structure

Bigas now generates comprehensive, structured reports with multiple components:

#### **Executive Summary**
- **Business-Focused Overview**: Clear summary of key performance trends and business impact
- **Critical Insights**: Top performing areas, biggest opportunities, and key bottlenecks
- **Immediate Actions**: Prioritized action items for the current week
- **Structured Format**: Bullet points and clear language for easy reading

#### **Detailed Q&A Analysis**
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Answers to 8 key marketing questions
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Specific metrics and trends analysis
- **Traffic Source Analysis**: Organic search, social, referral, and direct traffic insights
- **Page Performance**: Conversion rates, engagement metrics, and underperforming pages
- **Event Analysis**: Website events, trends, and optimization opportunities

#### **Concrete Marketing Recommendations**
- **5 Prioritized Actions**: High, medium, and low priority recommendations
- **Page-Specific**: Each recommendation references exact page URLs and elements
- **Actionable Steps**: Specific instructions for what to change
- **Quick Wins**: Focus on actions that can be implemented within 2 weeks

### AI Analysis Enhancement

With URLs, the AI can now provide much more specific suggestions:

#### Before
```
"Improve the homepage to increase conversions."
```

#### After
```
"**Homepage (https://bigas.com/) - 39 sessions, 0 conversions**
- Priority: High
- Effort: Quick
- Impact: High
- Actions:
  1. Add prominent CTA button above the fold
  2. Include customer testimonials
  3. Add trust signals (certifications, reviews)
  4. Optimize page load speed
  5. A/B test different headlines
```

### Technical Implementation

#### Data Flow
1. **GA4 Query** → Gets page paths and hostname from GA4
2. **Storage** → Stores raw data alongside AI answers
3. **Extraction** → Converts paths to URLs using actual domain
4. **Analysis** → Uses URLs in AI prompts for specific suggestions
5. **Output** → Provides clickable URLs in results

#### URL Construction
- **Automatic Domain Detection**: Extracts hostname from GA4 `hostName` dimension
- **Relative paths** (e.g., `/about-us`) → `https://actualdomain.com/about-us`
- **Absolute URLs** → Used as-is
- **Fallback** → Uses path if hostname not available

## 🌐 Enhanced Page Analysis with Web Scraping

### Overview

Bigas now includes advanced web scraping capabilities to analyze the actual content of underperforming pages and provide specific, actionable improvement suggestions based on real page content rather than generic advice.

### How It Works

#### 1. Page Content Analysis
When analyzing underperforming pages, the system:
- **Scrapes the actual page content** using web scraping technology
- **Analyzes page structure** including titles, headings, CTAs, forms, and content
- **Identifies specific issues** based on the actual page content
- **Provides concrete suggestions** tailored to what's actually on the page

#### 2. Content Elements Analyzed
The web scraper extracts and analyzes:
- **Page Title & Meta Description**: SEO and messaging effectiveness
- **Headings Structure**: Content hierarchy and messaging flow
- **Call-to-Action Buttons**: Number, placement, and effectiveness
- **Contact Forms**: Form fields, complexity, and conversion barriers
- **Images & Media**: Visual content and alt text optimization
- **Contact Information**: Phone numbers, emails, and accessibility
- **Social Proof Elements**: Testimonials, reviews, trust signals
- **Page Structure**: Navigation, footer, responsiveness

#### 3. Specific Analysis Output
Instead of generic advice, you get specific recommendations like:
- **"Add a prominent CTA button after the 'About Our Services' heading"**
- **"Simplify the contact form by removing the 'Company Size' field"**
- **"Add customer testimonials after the pricing section"**
- **"Include a phone number in the header for immediate contact"**

### Example Enhanced Analysis

#### Before (Generic Advice)
```
"Improve the homepage to increase conversions."
```

#### After (Content-Specific)
```
**Page Analysis: https://bigas.com/**

**Issues Found:**
- Only 2 CTA buttons found (both in footer)
- No contact information visible above the fold
- Missing customer testimonials or social proof
- Contact form has 6 fields (too many for conversion)

**Specific Action Items:**
1. Add "Get Started" CTA button after the main headline
2. Move phone number from footer to header
3. Add customer testimonials after the "Why Choose Us" section
4. Reduce contact form to 3 essential fields
5. Add trust badges near the pricing section
```

### Benefits

1. **Actionable Insights**: Specific suggestions based on actual page content
2. **No Generic Advice**: Every recommendation is tailored to your specific pages
3. **Implementation Ready**: Clear, specific action items you can implement immediately
4. **Content-Aware**: Understands your actual messaging and page structure
5. **Conversion-Focused**: Recommendations based on proven conversion optimization principles
