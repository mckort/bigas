## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The Bigas platform is designed as a **Modular Monolith**. This architecture provides the scalability benefits of microservices (like separation of concerns) without the initial operational complexity. A central API gateway routes requests to independent "AI Resources" that are managed within the same application.

Here is a high-level overview of the current structure:

```text
+--------------------------+
|         Clients          |
|  - Manual User (curl)    |
|  - Google Cloud Scheduler|
+--------------------------+
             |
             v
+--------------------------+
|   Google Cloud Run       |

| |  OpenAI, Discord)    | |  Jira, Figma, etc) | |
| +----------------------+ +--------------------+ |
|                                                 |
+-------------------------------------------------+
```

### Data Flow Explained:

1.  **Clients**: A user or automated service sends an HTTP request to an endpoint.
2.  **Google Cloud Run**: The request is received by the hosting environment.
3.  **Bigas Platform (`app.py`)**: The main Flask application receives the request.
4.  **API Router**: The app's internal router inspects the URL and forwards the request to the appropriate resource module.
    *   Requests to `/mcp/tools/ask_analytics_question` are routed to the **Marketing Resource**.
    *   A future request to `/mcp/tools/get_sprint_summary` would be routed to the **Product Resource**.
5.  **AI Resource**: The specific resource (e.g., Marketing) contains all the business logic to connect to external APIs (Google Analytics, OpenAI, etc.) and fulfill the request.
6.  **Response**: The resource returns a response, which is sent back to the client.

This structure allows you to easily add new resources (Sales, Support, etc.) by simply creating a new module in the `bigas/resources` directory, with minimal changes to the core application.

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-deployment-url.app/mcp/tools/weekly_analytics_report \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### What Gets Posted to Discord

When you run this endpoint, it automatically:
1. Fetches the last 7 days of Google Analytics data
2. Generates a comprehensive report with key metrics
3. Posts the report to your Discord channel
4. Creates an AI-powered Q&A summary

### Example Discord Output

Here's what you'll see posted to your Discord channel:

```
Weekly Analytics report on its way...

Q: What are the primary traffic sources contributing to total sessions?
A: Here's how your 43 total sessions broke down by channel:
‚Ä¢ Organic Search: 19 sessions (44%)
‚Ä¢ Direct: 18 sessions (42%)
‚Ä¢ Organic Social: 6 sessions (14%)

Key takeaways:
‚Ä¢ Organic Search is your top source, closely followed by Direct visits
‚Ä¢ Social is a smaller driver of traffic right now
‚Ä¢ Referral, paid search and email all registered zero sessions‚Äîthese could be untapped opportunities

Q: What is the average session duration and pages per session?
A: Across all users, you had 43 sessions, with a total engagement time of 764 seconds and 95 page views:
‚Ä¢ Average session duration ‚âà 17.8 seconds
‚Ä¢ Pages per session ‚âà 2.2

Key takeaways:
‚Ä¢ An average visit of under 20 seconds is quite short
‚Ä¢ Viewing just over two pages per visit suggests modest exploration

Q: Which pages are the most visited?
A: Top pages by sessions:
‚Ä¢ Homepage "/" ‚Äì 38 sessions
‚Ä¢ Get-in-touch "/get-in-touch-with-us" ‚Äì 13 sessions
‚Ä¢ About us "/about-us" ‚Äì 9 sessions

Summary Recommendations:
‚Ä¢ Set up and verify conversion tracking
‚Ä¢ Boost homepage engagement & conversions
‚Ä¢ Optimize high-traffic Contact & About Us pages
‚Ä¢ Deepen session duration & page depth
‚Ä¢ Diversify traffic sources
```

### Prerequisites

Before testing, ensure you have:
- ‚úÖ `GA4_PROPERTY_ID` configured
- ‚úÖ `OPENAI_API_KEY` configured  
- ‚úÖ `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` configured
- ‚úÖ Valid Google Analytics data for the last 7 days

### Testing Tips

- **First Time**: Run once to verify Discord integration works
- **Data Check**: Ensure your GA4 property has recent data
- **Webhook Test**: Verify your Discord webhook URL is correct
- **Rate Limits**: The report generation can take 30-60 seconds

### Scheduling Weekly Reports

For automated weekly reports, you can use **Google Cloud Scheduler** to call the endpoint automatically. This allows you to:

- **Schedule regular reports**: Set up weekly, daily, or custom intervals
- **Automate workflows**: No manual intervention required
- **Flexible timing**: Choose the best time for your team to receive reports
- **Easy management**: Pause, resume, or update schedules as needed

Simply configure a Cloud Scheduler job to make a POST request to your weekly analytics report endpoint at your preferred schedule.

## Adding a New Analytics Question (Template-Driven)

To add a new analytics question using the template-driven system:

1. **Edit `bigas/resources/marketing/service.py`:**
   - Add a new entry to the `QUESTION_TEMPLATES` dictionary at the top of the file. Use the existing entries as examples. Specify the GA4 metrics, dimensions, and (optionally) filters, order_by, or postprocess helpers.
   - Example:
     ```python
     QUESTION_TEMPLATES = {
         # ... existing templates ...
         "my_new_question": {
             "dimensions": ["country", "deviceCategory"],
             "metrics": ["activeUsers", "sessions"],
             "postprocess": "my_custom_processor"  # Optional
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Add a post-processing function (if needed):**
   - Edit `bigas/resources/marketing/utils.py` and add your custom processing function
   - Example:
     ```python
     def my_custom_processor(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
         """Custom processing for my new question."""
         # Your processing logic here
         return data
     ```

3. **Use the template in your code:**
   - Call `service.run_template_query("my_new_question")` to get the data
   - Or create a dedicated method like `answer_my_new_question()` in the service
