## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The Bigas platform is designed as a **Modular Monolith**. This architecture provides the scalability benefits of microservices (like separation of concerns) without the initial operational complexity. A central API gateway routes requests to independent "AI Resources" that are managed within the same application.

Here is a high-level overview of the current structure:

```text
+--------------------------+
|         Clients          |
|  - Manual User (curl)    |
|  - Google Cloud Scheduler|
+--------------------------+
             |
             v
+--------------------------+
|   Google Cloud Run       |
|  (Hosting Environment)   |
+--------------------------+
             |
             v
+-------------------------------------------------+
|  Bigas Platform (app.py - Flask App)            |
|                                                 |
| +---------------------------------------------+ |
| | API Gateway / Router                        | |

|   | (/marketing/*)       | (/product/*)         |
|   v                      v                      |
| +----------------------+ +--------------------+ |
| | Marketing Resource   | | Product Resource   | |
| | (Connects to GA,     | | (Placeholder for   | |
| |  OpenAI, Discord)    | |  Jira, Figma, etc) | |
| +----------------------+ +--------------------+ |
|                                                 |
+-------------------------------------------------+
```

### Data Flow Explained:

1.  **Clients**: A user or automated service sends an HTTP request to an endpoint.
2.  **Google Cloud Run**: The request is received by the hosting environment.
3.  **Bigas Platform (`app.py`)**: The main Flask application receives the request.
4.  **API Router**: The app's internal router inspects the URL and forwards the request to the appropriate resource module.
    *   Requests to `/mcp/tools/ask_analytics_question` are routed to the **Marketing Resource**.
    *   A future request to `/mcp/tools/get_sprint_summary` would be routed to the **Product Resource**.
5.  **AI Resource**: The specific resource (e.g., Marketing) contains all the business logic to connect to external APIs (Google Analytics, OpenAI, etc.) and fulfill the request.
6.  **Response**: The resource returns a response, which is sent back to the client.

This structure allows you to easily add new resources (Sales, Support, etc.) by simply creating a new module in the `bigas/resources` directory, with minimal changes to the core application.
