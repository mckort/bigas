## üìä Overview

**Bigas** is an AI team concept designed to provide virtual specialists for different business functions. We've started with our first virtual team member: **The Marketing Specialist**.

### üéØ Our Goal

To build a comprehensive AI team that can handle various business functions, starting with marketing and expanding to other areas like sales, customer support, product development, and more.

### üöÄ Current Implementation: Virtual Marketing Specialist

Bigas is now an **AI-powered marketing analytics platform** that automatically generates comprehensive weekly reports with actionable insights. It combines Google Analytics 4 data with OpenAI's GPT-4 to provide intelligent marketing recommendations.

## üîå Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

**‚úÖ Fully MCP 2025 Compliant Server** - Ready for AI client integration

Bigas Core implements the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) specification, making it compatible with MCP-enabled AI clients like Claude and other LLM applications.

### MCP Configuration

```json
{
    "manifestUrl": "https://mcp-marketing-919623369853.europe-north1.run.app/mcp/manifest",
    "openapiUrl": "https://mcp-marketing-919623369853.europe-north1.run.app/openapi.json"
}
```

### MCP Features
- **10 MCP Tools**: Complete analytics toolkit accessible via natural language
- **JSON-RPC 2.0**: Standard MCP transport protocol
- **Secure HTTPS**: Production-ready with proper authentication
- **Tool Categories**: Analytics queries, report generation, storage management, page optimization

### Quick MCP Integration
1. Add the above configuration to your MCP client
2. Access tools via natural language: *"Generate a weekly analytics report"*
3. Use storage tools: *"Get the latest stored report"* 
4. Analyze pages: *"Find underperforming pages and suggest improvements"*

> **Note**: Live analytics tools require application context. Storage and report analysis tools work directly via MCP.

## üéØ Enhanced Underperforming Page Analysis

Our most advanced feature provides **specific, actionable improvement suggestions** based on real page content rather than generic advice.

### How It Works

#### 1. Page Content Analysis

When analyzing underperforming pages, the system:

* **Scrapes the actual page content** using web scraping technology
* **Analyzes page structure** including titles, headings, CTAs, forms, and content
* **Identifies specific issues** based on the actual page content
* **Provides concrete suggestions** tailored to what's actually on the page

#### 2. Content Elements Analyzed

The web scraper extracts and analyzes:

* **Page Title & Meta Description**: SEO and messaging effectiveness
* **Headings Structure**: Content hierarchy and messaging flow
* **Call-to-Action Buttons**: Number, placement, and effectiveness
* **Contact Forms**: Form fields, complexity, and conversion barriers
* **Images & Media**: Visual content and alt text optimization
* **Contact Information**: Phone numbers, emails, and accessibility
* **Social Proof Elements**: Testimonials, reviews, trust signals
* **Page Structure**: Navigation, footer, responsiveness

#### 3. Specific Analysis Output

Instead of generic advice, you get specific recommendations like:

* **"Add a prominent CTA button after the 'About Our Services' heading"**
* **"Simplify the contact form by removing the 'Company Size' field"**
* **"Add customer testimonials after the pricing section"**
* **"Include a phone number in the header for immediate contact"**

### Example Enhanced Analysis

#### Before (Generic Advice)
```
"Improve the homepage to increase conversions."
```

#### After (Content-Specific)
```
**Page Analysis: https://bigas.com/**

**Issues Found:**
- Only 2 CTA buttons found (both in footer)
- No contact information visible above the fold
- Missing customer testimonials or social proof
- Contact form has 6 fields (too many for conversion)

**Specific Action Items:**
1. Add "Get Started" CTA button after the main headline
2. Move phone number from footer to header
3. Add customer testimonials after the "Why Choose Us" section
4. Reduce contact form to 3 essential fields
5. Add trust badges near the pricing section
```

### Benefits

1. **Actionable Insights**: Specific suggestions based on actual page content
2. **No Generic Advice**: Every recommendation is tailored to your specific pages
3. **Implementation Ready**: Clear, specific action items you can implement immediately
4. **Content-Aware**: Understands your actual messaging and page structure
5. **Conversion-Focused**: Recommendations based on proven conversion optimization principles
