# Run Bigas AI PR review and post/update a single comment on the PR.
# This workflow is in the Bigas repo so we can test PR review on Bigas itself.
# In any repo (including this one), configure:
#   Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
#   - Variable: BIGAS_URL = your Bigas Cloud Run URL
#   - Secret:   BIGAS_API_KEY = one of your Bigas access keys (BIGAS_ACCESS_KEYS)
#   - Secret:   GH_PAT_FOR_BIGAS = GitHub PAT with repo scope (optional if GITHUB_TOKEN is in Bigas Secret Manager)
